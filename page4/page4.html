          <h1>Indian Ocean</h1>
        </div>
        <article class="part1">
          <p>
            The Indian Ocean is the third-largest of the world's five oceanic
            divisions, covering 70,560,000 km2 (27,240,000 sq mi) or
            approximately 20% of the water area of Earth's surface.[4] It is
            bounded by Asia to the north, Africa to the west and Australia to
            the east. To the south it is bounded by the Southern Ocean, or
            Antarctica, depending on the definition in use.[5] The Indian Ocean
            has large marginal, or regional seas, such as the Andaman Sea, the
            Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the Laccadive Sea. Once called
            the Eastern Ocean, it is now named after India, which protrudes into
            it, and has been known by its current name since at least 1515. It
            is the only ocean named after a country. It has an average depth of
            3,741 m. All of the Indian Ocean is in the Eastern Hemisphere.
            Unlike the Atlantic and Pacific, the Indian Ocean is bordered by
            landmasses and an archipelago on three sides, making it more like an
            embayed ocean centered on the Indian Peninsula. Its coasts and
            shelves differ from other oceans, with distinct features, such as a
            narrower continental shelf. In terms of geology, the Indian Ocean is
            the youngest of the major oceans, with active spreading ridges and
            features like seamounts and ridges formed by hotspots. The climate
            of the Indian Ocean is characterized by monsoons. It is the warmest
            ocean, with a significant impact on global climate due to its
            interaction with the atmosphere. Its waters are affected by the
            Indian Ocean Walker circulation, resulting in unique oceanic
            currents and upwelling patterns. The Indian Ocean is ecologically
            diverse, with important marine life and ecosystems like coral reefs,
            mangroves, and sea grass beds. It hosts a significant portion of the
            world's tuna catch and is home to endangered marine species. It
            faces challenges like overfishing and pollution, including a
            significant garbage patch.

            <h4>Geography</h4>
            <p class="p">
              The borders of the Indian Ocean, as delineated by the
              International Hydrographic Organization in 1953 included the
              Southern Ocean but not the marginal seas along the northern rim
              but in 2002 the IHO delimited the Southern Ocean separately, which
              removed waters south of 60째s from the Indian Ocean but included
              the northern marginal seas.Meridionally, the Indian Ocean is
              delimited from the Atlantic Ocean by the 20째 east meridian,
              running south from Cape Agulhas, South Africa, and from the
              Pacific Ocean by the meridian of 146째49'E, running south from
              South East Cape on the island of Tasmania in Australia. The
              northernmost extent of the Indian Ocean (including marginal seas)
              is approximately 30째 north in the Persian Gulf

            <h4>History</h4>
            <p class="p">
              The Indian Ocean, together with the Mediterranean, has connected
              people since ancient times, whereas the Atlantic and Pacific have
              had the roles of barriers or mare incognitum. The written history
              of the Indian Ocean, however, has been Eurocentric and largely
              dependent on the availability of written sources from the European
              colonial era. This history is often divided into an ancient period
              followed by an Islamic period; the subsequent colonial-era periods
              are often subdivided into Portuguese, Dutch, and British
              periods.Milo Kearney argues that the postwar time period can also
              be split into a period of competition for oil during the Cold War
              followed by American dominance.[

            <h4>Marine life</h4>
            <p class="p">
              Among the tropical oceans, the western Indian Ocean hosts one of
              the largest concentrations of phytoplankton blooms in summer, due
              to the strong monsoon winds. The monsoonal wind forcing leads to a
              strong coastal and open ocean upwelling, which introduces
              nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available
              for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. These
              phytoplankton blooms support the marine ecosystem, as the base of
              the marine food web, and eventually the larger fish species. The
              Indian Ocean accounts for the second-largest share of the most
              economically valuable tuna catch.Its fish are of great and growing
              importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and
              export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan
              also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna
