                The ocean is the body of salt water that covers approximately
                70.8% of Earth. In English, the term ocean also refers to any of
                the large bodies of water into which the world ocean is
                conventionally divided.The following names describe five
                different areas of the ocean: Pacific, Atlantic, Indian,
                Antarctic/Southern, and Arctic.The ocean contains 97% of Earth's
                waterand is the primary component of Earth's hydrosphere; thus
                the ocean is essential to life on Earth. The ocean influences
                climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water
                cycle by acting as a huge heat reservoir.

                Ocean scientists split the ocean into vertical and horizontal
                zones based on physical and biological conditions. The pelagic
                zone is the open ocean's water column from the surface to the
                ocean floor. The water column is further divided into zones
                based on depth and the amount of light present. The photic zone
                starts at the surface and is defined to be "the depth at which
                light intensity is only 1% of the surface value": 36 
                (approximately 200 m in the open ocean). This is the zone where
                photosynthesis can occur. In this process plants and microscopic
                algae (free floating phytoplankton) use light, water, carbon
                dioxide, and nutrients to produce organic matter. As a result,
                the photic zone is the most biodiverse and the source of the
                food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem. Ocean
                photosynthesis also produces half of the oxygen in the Earth's
                atmosphere.Light can only penetrate a few hundred more meters;
                the rest of the deeper ocean is cold and dark (these zones are
                called mesopelagic and aphotic zones). The continental shelf is
                where the ocean meets dry land. It is more shallow, with a depth
                of a few hundred meters or less. Human activity often has
                negative impacts on marine life within the continental shelf.

                Ocean temperatures depend on the amount of solar radiation
                reaching the ocean surface. In the tropics, surface temperatures
                can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F). Near the poles where sea ice
                forms, the temperature in equilibrium is about −2 °C (28 °F). In
                all parts of the ocean, deep ocean temperatures range between −2
                °C (28 °F) and 5 °C (41 °F).Constant circulation of water in the
                ocean creates ocean currents. Those currents are caused by
                forces operating on the water, such as temperature and salinity
                differences, atmospheric circulation (wind), and the Coriolis
                effect. Tides create tidal currents, while wind and waves cause
                surface currents. The Gulf Stream, Kuroshio Current, Agulhas
                Current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current are all major ocean
                currents. Such currents transport massive amounts of water,
                gases, pollutants and heat to different parts of the world, and
                from the surface into the deep ocean. All this has impacts on
                the global climate system.

                Ocean water contains dissolved gases, including oxygen, carbon
                dioxide and nitrogen. An exchange of these gases occurs at the
                ocean's surface. The solubility of these gases depends on the
                temperature and salinity of the water.The carbon dioxide
                concentration in the atmosphere is rising due to CO2 emissions,
                mainly from fossil fuel combustion. As the oceans absorb CO2
                from the atmosphere, a higher concentration leads to ocean
                acidification (a drop in pH value)

            <h4>Terminology</h4>

            <details>
              <span class="spa">
                The terms "the ocean" or "the sea" used without specification
                refer to the interconnected body of salt water covering the
                majority of Earth's surface.It includes the Pacific, Atlantic,
                Indian, Southern/Antarctic, and Arctic oceans. As a general
                term, "the ocean" and "the sea" are often interchangeable.
                Strictly speaking, a "sea" is a body of water (generally a
                division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by
                land.The word "sea" can also be used for many specific, much
                smaller bodies of seawater, such as the North Sea or the Red
                Sea. There is no sharp distinction between seas and oceans,
                though generally seas are smaller, and are often partly (as
                marginal seas) or wholly (as inland seas) bordered by land

                "World Ocean" redirects here. Not to be confused with ocean
                world. "Ocean Sea" redirects here. For the 1993 novel by
                Alessandro Baricco, see Ocean Sea (novel). The contemporary
                concept of the World Ocean was coined in the early 20th century
                by the Russian oceanographer Yuly Shokalsky to refer to the
                continuous ocean that covers and encircles most of Earth.The
                global, interconnected body of salt water is sometimes referred
                to as the World Ocean, global ocean or the great ocean. The
                concept of a continuous body of water with relatively
                unrestricted exchange between its components is critical in
                oceanography.

            <details>
              <span class="spa">
                Scientists believe that a sizable quantity of water would have
                been in the material that formed Earth.Water molecules would
                have escaped Earth's gravity more easily when it was less
                massive during its formation. This is called atmospheric escape.
                During planetary formation, Earth possibly had magma oceans.
                Subsequently, outgassing, volcanic activity and meteorite
                impacts, produced an early atmosphere of carbon dioxide,
                nitrogen and water vapor, according to current theories. The
                gases and the atmosphere are thought to have accumulated over
                millions of years. After Earth's surface had significantly
                cooled, the water vapor over time would have condensed, forming
                Earth's first oceans.The early oceans might have been
                significantly hotter than today and appeared green due to high
                iron content.

            <details>
              <span class="spa">
                The origin of Earth's oceans is unknown. Oceans are thought to
                have formed in the Hadean eon and may have been the cause for
                the emergence of life. Plate tectonics, post-glacial rebound,
                and sea level rise continually change the coastline and
                structure of the world ocean. A global ocean has existed in one
                form or another on Earth for eons. Since its formation the ocean
                has taken many conditions and shapes with many past ocean
                divisions and potentially at times covering the whole globe.[41]
                During colder climatic periods, more ice caps and glaciers form,
                and enough of the global water supply accumulates as ice to
                lessen the amounts in other parts of the water cycle. The
                reverse is true during warm periods. During the last ice age,
                glaciers covered almost one-third of Earth's land mass with the
                result being that the oceans were about 122 m (400 ft) lower
                than today.
