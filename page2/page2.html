            The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth's five oceanic
            divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the
            Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the
            south, and is bounded by the continents of Asia and Australia in the
            west and the Americas in the east.At 165,250,000 square kilometers
            (63,800,000 square miles) in area (as defined with a southern
            Antarctic border), this largest division of the World Ocean and the
            hydrosphere covers about 46% of Earth's water surface and about 32%
            of the planet's total surface area, larger than its entire land area
            (148,000,000 km2 (57,000,000 sq mi)). The centers of both the Water
            Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere, as well as the oceanic pole
            of inaccessibility, are in the Pacific Ocean. Ocean circulation
            (caused by the Coriolis effect) subdivides it[2] into two largely
            independent volumes of water that meet at the equator, the North
            Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean (or more loosely the South
            Seas). The Pacific Ocean can also be informally divided by the
            International Date Line into the East Pacific and the West Pacific,
            which allows it to be further divided into four quadrants, namely
            the Northeast Pacific off the coasts of North America, the Southeast
            Pacific off South America, Northwest Pacific off Far Eastern/Pacific
            Asia, and the Southwest Pacific around Oceania.

            Across the continents of Asia, Australia and the Americas, more than
            25,000 islands, large and small, rise above the surface of the
            Pacific Ocean. Multiple islands were the shells of former active
            volcanoes that have lain dormant for thousands of years. Close to
            the equator, without vast areas of blue ocean, are a dot of atolls
            that have over intervals of time been formed by seamounts as a
            result of tiny coral islands strung in a ring within surroundings of
            a central lagoon

            The Pacific separates Asia and Australia from the Americas. It may
            be further subdivided by the equator into northern (North Pacific)
            and southern (South Pacific) portions. It extends from the Antarctic
            region in the South to the Arctic in the north.The Pacific Ocean
            encompasses approximately one-third of the Earth's surface, having
            an area of 165,200,000 km2 (63,800,000 sq mi) â€“ larger than Earth's
            entire landmass combined, 150,000,000 km2 (58,000,000 sq mi)

            The Northwestern Pacific Ocean is most susceptible to micro plastic
            pollution due to its proximity to highly populated countries like
            Japan and China.The quantity of small plastic fragments floating in
            the north-east Pacific Ocean increased a hundredfold between 1972
            and 2012.The ever-growing Great Pacific garbage patch between
            California and Japan is three times the size of France.An estimated
            80,000 metric tons of plastic inhabit the patch, totaling 1.8
            trillion pieces

            The Pacific Ocean provides a rich feeding ground for many types of
            wildlife. Important ecosystems of the Pacific include seagrass
            meadows, which are important breeding and feeding grounds for
            manatees and dugongs. Coral reefs are vital parts of the food chain.
            They support thousands of marine species, including reef fish,
            sharks, and sea turtles

            The Pacific Ocean has most of the islands in the world. There are
            about 25,000 islands in the Pacific Ocean.The islands entirely
            within the Pacific Ocean can be divided into three main groups known
            as Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia. Micronesia, which lies north
            of the equator and west of the International Date Line, includes the
            Mariana Islands in the northwest, the Caroline Islands in the
            center, the Marshall Islands to the east and the islands of Kiribati
            in the southeast
