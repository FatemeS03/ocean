          <h4 id="click1">Origin Of The Name</h4>

          <p>
            The oldest recorded mention of the name “Atlantic” was in the
            Histories of Herodotus of Ancient Greek around 450 BC. In the Greek
            language, the word “Atlantis” loosely translates to “island of
            Atlas,” or in some texts as “Sea of Atlas.” However, even until 360
            BC, there was still no mention of the ocean in any written language,
            except for its mythological description by a Greek philosopher named
            Plato
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="part">
          <h4 id="click2">Origin And Development</h4>

          <p>
            The Atlantic Ocean’s origin and development are based on plate
            tectonics and continental shelf theories. The Pangea, an ancient
            supercontinent, began rifting about 180 million years ago. The
            rifting caused the Eastern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere to
            drift apart, leading to the Atlantic Ocean Basin formation. As can
            be seen from the world maps, Europe and North America’s continental
            shorelines, and those of Africa and South America, almost match. If
            these continental shelves’ edges are matched, they fit almost
            perfectly.

          <h4 id="click3">Geography</h4>

          <p>
            The Atlantic Ocean covers about 41.1 million square miles or 20% of
            the Earth's total area. The North Atlantic Ocean spans 16.02 million
            square miles, while the South Atlantic Ocean covers about 15.55
            million square miles. It is 27,480 feet deep at the deepest point
            (Puerto Rico Trench) but has an average depth of 11,962 feet below
            the water surface. Its volume is about 74.5 million cubic miles,
            while the shore length is 69,510 miles. It is connected in the
            southwest to the Pacific Ocean, southeast to the Indian Ocean, the
            Arctic Ocean in the north, and south to the Southern Sea.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="part">
          <h4 id="click4">Climate</h4>

          <p>
            The Atlantic Ocean’s climate is influenced by several factors,
            including wind, water current, and surface water temperature.
            Although maritime climates are prevalent, they are moderate with
            little seasonal variations. The North Atlantic weather is determined
            by the amount of air mass and wind current originating from North
            America. Since the atmospheric pressure near Iceland is low, air
            often flows in a counterclockwise direction. However, the region
            near the Azores is a high-pressure area. When the low and high
            atmospheric pressures meet, westerly winds form and prevail across
            Western Europe and the North Atlantic.

        <div class="part">
          <h4 id="click5">Hydrology</h4>

          <p>
            The ocean’s surface water temperature is influenced by factors, such
            as seasons, the current system, and latitude. It ranges from 28
            degrees Fahrenheit to over 86 degrees Fahrenheit. The highest
            temperatures are recorded north of the equator, while Polar Regions
            record minimum values. Sea ice often covers the ocean’s surface
            between October and June in Denmark Strait, Labrador Sea, and Baltic
            Sea. The Coriolis Effect causes the South Atlantic water to
            circulate in an anticlockwise motion and North Atlantic water to
            circulate in a clockwise direction.

          <h4 id="click6">Bathymetry</h4>

          <p>
            The bathymetry of the Atlantic is dominated by a submarine mountain
            range called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). It runs from 87°N or 300
            km (190 mi) south of the North Pole to the subantarctic Bouvet
            Island at 54°S.[24] Expeditions to explore the bathymertry of the
            Atlantic include the Challenger expedition and the German Meteor
            expedition; as of 2001, Columbia University's Lamont–Doherty Earth
            Observatory and the United States Navy Hydrographic Office conduct
            research on the ocean

          <h4 id="click7">Water characteristics</h4>

          <p>
            Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current
            systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of
            solar energy, range from below −2 °C (28 °F) to over 30 °C (86 °F).
            Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values
            are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of
            maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7–8 °C (13–14 °F)

          <h4 id="click8">History</h4>

          <p>
            Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies indicate that 80–60,000 years ago
            a major demographic expansion within Africa, derived from a single,
            small population, coincided with the emergence of behavioral
            complexity and the rapid MIS 5–4 environmental changes. This group
            of people not only expanded over the whole of Africa, but also
            started to disperse out of Africa into Asia, Europe, and Australasia
            around 65,000 years ago and quickly replaced the archaic humans in
            these regions

            The Atlantic has contributed significantly to the development and
            economy of surrounding countries. Besides major transatlantic
            transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers
            abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the
            continental shelves.

          <p>
            Northeast Atlantic is schematically limited to the 40°00' west
            longitude (except around Greenland), south to the 36°00' north
            latitude, and to the 68°30' east longitude, with both the west and
            east longitude limits reaching to the north pole. The Atlantic's
            subareas include: Barents Sea; Norwegian Sea, Spitzbergen, and Bear
            Island; Skagerrak, Kattegat, Sound, Belt Sea, and Baltic Sea; North
            Sea; Iceland and Faroes Grounds; Rockall, Northwest Coast of
            Scotland, and North Ireland; Irish Sea, West of Ireland, Porcupine

            Portuguese Waters; Azores Grounds and Northeast Atlantic South;

            tons in the early 1970s to 1.9 million tons in 2013. During the 21st
            century, some species have shown weak signs of recovery, including
            Greenland halibut, yellowtail flounder, Atlantic halibut, haddock,
            spiny dogfish, while other stocks shown no such signs, including
            cod, witch flounder, and redfish. Stocks of invertebrates, in
            contrast, remain at record levels of abundance. 31% of stocks are

            Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of
            potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits
            are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as
            well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting
            chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zon
